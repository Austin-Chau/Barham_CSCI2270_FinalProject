# Barham_CSCI2270_FinalProject

# Project	Summary
This project will implement 5 different sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort, and merge sort. In each of the sorting functions, counters will keep track of the algorithm's efficiency when sorting arrays of numbers. The user will choose the array size (a limit for array size will be specified), and three arrays of that size will be created by the program for sorting. One array will already be sorted, another will be in reverse order, and another will be in random order. The program then runs each of the sorting methods on the three arrays and stores the number of counts associated with each. The program then outputs the gathered data. In order to gather more information about the performance of a single sorting algorithm and how its performance changes with data size, another option will allow the user to select a sorting method, and then the program will sort arrays of size 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000. The sorted arrays will not be printed, but data about the efficiency of the selected algorithm when sorting each array will be printed.
